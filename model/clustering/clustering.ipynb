    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Method 1 (Baseline): Unsupervised Clustering** for the mental health dimension reduction project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this method is to explore the **intrinsic semantic structure** of survey questions drawn from multiple validated mental health and well-being scales (e.g., PSQI, PSS, PWB, CD-RISC, UCLA Loneliness, PERMA).  \n",
    "Rather than relying on predefined scale boundaries or scoring rules, we examine how questions **naturally group together in semantic embedding space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves as:\n",
    "- A **baseline method** for understanding latent dimensions across surveys\n",
    "- A reference point for later **supervised classification** and **LLM-based approaches**"
