    "# Semantic Mapping of Mental Health Survey Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Method 1 (Baseline): Semantic Mapping** for the mental health dimension reduction project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this method is to map diverse mental health survey questions onto a shared set of **eight high-level wellness dimensions** (Emotional, Social, Physical, Occupational, Intellectual, Spiritual, Environmental, Financial) using a **concept-driven, label-free approach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning dimensions from data, this method defines each wellness dimension through a short natural-language description, which acts as a **semantic prototype (anchor)**. Both survey questions and dimension prototypes are embedded into the same semantic space using a pretrained language model. Each question is then assigned to the most semantically similar dimension(s) based on cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic mapping operationalizes theoretical wellness constructs directly in embedding space, forming a principled bridge between psychological theory and data-driven modeling."

    "- `dataset`: the source questionnaire or scale\n",
