    "# Semantic Mapping of Mental Health Survey Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Method 1 (Baseline): Semantic Mapping** for the mental health dimension reduction project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this method is to map diverse mental health survey questions onto a shared set of **high-level wellness dimensions** (Emotional, Social, Physical, Occupational, Intellectual, Spiritual, Environmental, Financial) using a **concept-driven, label-free approach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than learning dimension representations from labeled data, this approach begins by defining the *same set of wellness dimension types* using **natural-language definitions generated by multiple large language models (LLMs)**.  \n",
    "Each LLM is prompted with an identical instruction, producing alternative textual realizations of the same conceptual dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These model-generated dimension definitions serve as **semantic prototypes (anchors)**. Both survey questions and dimension prototypes are embedded into a shared semantic space using a pretrained sentence encoder. Survey questions are then mapped back to the wellness dimensions by measuring cosine similarity to the corresponding prototypes, allowing each question to be assigned to one or more dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By holding the dimension types fixed while varying the language used to define them, this method enables controlled comparisons of how different LLM-generated definitions influence semantic alignment and downstream mappings. Semantic mapping thus provides a principled bridge between conceptual wellness frameworks and data-driven analysis."

    "## 4. Semantic Mapping Using LLM-Generated Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we perform semantic mapping between survey questions and\n",
    "wellness dimensions using the `SemanticMapper` module\n",
    "(`model/mapping/semantic_mapper.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "For each set of dimension definitions generated by a large language model (LLM),\n",
    "we independently perform a full semantic mapping process.\n",
    "This results in **one mapping output per LLM**, allowing us to compare\n",
    "consistency and variation across models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping procedure consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoding**\n",
    "   - Survey questions and wellness dimension definitions are embedded into a\n",
    "     shared semantic space using a pretrained sentence embedding model\n",
    "     (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).\n",
    "   - The same encoder is used for both questions and dimensions to ensure\n",
    "     comparability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Similarity Computation**\n",
    "   - For each question, cosine similarity is computed against all dimension\n",
    "     embeddings, producing a question–dimension similarity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Margin-Based Assignment**\n",
    "   - Each question is first assigned to the dimension with the highest\n",
    "     similarity score.\n",
    "   - Additional dimensions are included if their similarity scores fall within\n",
    "     a predefined margin (`delta`) of the top score.\n",
    "   - This allows a single question to be assigned to **multiple dimensions**\n",
    "     when semantic overlap exists, reflecting the multifaceted nature of\n",
    "     mental health constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each mapping run produces a table (CSV) where **each row corresponds to one survey question mapped under one LLM-generated dimension set**. Conceptually, each row has the following structure:\n",

    "## 4. Analysis: Cross-Model Agreement Using Pairwise Jaccard Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether semantic mappings are stable across different LLM-generated dimension definitions, we compare the dimension assignments produced by five independent definition sets. Each set is generated by a different large language model (LLM), while the embedding model, similarity metric, and decision rule remain fixed.\n",

    "### Pairwise Jaccard Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given survey question, let $$D_i$$ and $$D_j$$ denote the sets of dimensions assigned by two different LLM-generated definition sets. The Jaccard similarity between the two assignments is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(D_i, D_j)\n",
    "=\n",
    "\\frac{|D_i \\cap D_j|}{|D_i \\cup D_j|}\n",

    "\\frac{|D_i \\cap D_j|}{|D_i \\cup D_j|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$K = 5$$ is the number of LLMs, resulting in $$\\binom{5}{2} = 10$$ model pairs per question.\n",
    "\n",
    "This average score captures how similar the dimension assignments are *on average* across models, without requiring strict unanimity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a survey question mapped by five different LLM-generated dimension sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model 1: {Emotional, Social}  \n",
    "- Model 2: {Emotional, Social}  \n",
    "- Model 3: {Emotional, Social}  \n",
    "- Model 4: {Emotional}  \n",
    "- Model 5: {Emotional}  \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the 10 model pairs:\n",
    "- 4 pairs compare identical sets {Emotional, Social}, yielding $$J = 1.0$$\n",
    "- 6 pairs compare {Emotional, Social} with {Emotional}, yielding $$J = 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean pairwise Jaccard similarity is therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{J}\n",
    "=\n",

    "=\n",
    "0.75\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A value of $$\\bar{J} = 0.75$$ indicates that, on average, any two models share most of their assigned dimensions for this question. This reflects **strong overall agreement**, with disagreements limited to secondary dimensions rather than the core interpretation."
